# Generative-Graphic-Project

Created by Tamboo aka Andrea Tamburrino in collab w/ Giacomo Paino.

This project was created for the final exam of the Generative Graphics class at the Audiovisual Innovation Master at BAU (https://www.baued.es/).
The course was taught by Multimedia Artist Diego Suarez Barcena (http://diegosuba.com/).

The 3D shapes were inspired by Daniel Shiffman's website (https://thecodingtrain.com/)
and specifically the "Mandelbulb" challenge (https://thecodingtrain.com/challenges/168-the-mandelbulb).


Project modules:
- **HandsPositionSender:** Detects hands and sends their positions through OSC.
* **Drawer:** Draws the 3D model and uses the received hand positions to move the camera by zooming and rotating around the model.



Libraries used:
- **KinectPV2:** (https://codigogenerativo.com/code/kinectpv2-k4w2-processing-library/)
* **PeasyCam:** (https://mrfeinberg.com/peasycam/)
